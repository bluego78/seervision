# Getting Started with the app

The app is totally working, it calls a node.js service to get/set data of the todo list.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), you just have to clone the repository on your local folder and then run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

##IMPORTANT: to avoid CORS Blocking the async calls to the service, please open the app in your broser disabling CORS.
Example for Chrome on Windows launch from START->RUN this command: chrome.exe --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=C:\tmp

# to test the app

Please run:
### `npm test`
